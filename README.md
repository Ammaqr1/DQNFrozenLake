# DQNFrozenLake

This project implements Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI's gym. The goal is to navigate a frozen lake and reach a goal without falling into holes.

## Demo

Here is a demonstration of the project in action:

## Features

- **Deep Q-Network**: Utilizes a neural network to approximate Q-values.
- **OpenAI Gym**: Uses the Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI's gym library.
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balances exploration and exploitation using an epsilon-greedy policy.
- **Experience Replay**: Implements experience replay to improve training stability and efficiency.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
